The load switching device should have an independent switching program for each relay.
The circuit program should be subdivided into daily, weekly, seasonal, and annual programs.
The central system manages the switching program.
The central system transmits the switching program to the load switching device via communication paths.
The circuit program must be read-back for control purposes.
The central system must log any changes to the circuit program in a logbook.
The central system sends changed switching programs to the load switching device.
Meanwhile, the load switching device receives and logs the changes in the logbook.
