	abstract = {Business process compliance is a key area of business process management and aims at ensuring that processes obey to compliance constraints such as regulatory constraints or business rules imposed on them. Process compliance can be checked during process design time based on veriﬁcation of process models and at runtime based on monitoring the compliance states of running process instances. For existing compliance monitoring approaches it remains unclear whether and how compliance violations can be predicted, although predictions are crucial in order to prepare and take countermeasures in time. This work, hence, analyzes existing literature from compliance monitoring as well as predictive process monitoring and provides an updated framework of compliance monitoring functionalities. Moreover, it raises the vision of a comprehensive predictive compliance monitoring system that integrates existing predicate prediction approaches with the idea of employing {PPM} with diﬀerent prediction goals such as next activity or remaining time for prediction and subsequent mapping of the prediction results onto the given set of compliance constraints ({PCM}). For each compliance monitoring functionality we elicit {PCM} system requirements and assess their coverage by existing approaches. Based on the assessment, open challenges and research directions realizing a comprehensive {PCM} system are elaborated.},

	abstract = {Few-Shot Learning refers to the problem of learning the underlying pattern in the data just from a few training samples. Requiring a large number of data samples, many deep learning solutions suffer from data hunger and extensively high computation time and resources. Furthermore, data is often not available due to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost of data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous human tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently proposed few-shot learning algorithms. Given the learning dynamics and characteristics, the approaches to few-shot learning problems are discussed in the perspectives of meta-learning, transfer learning, and hybrid approaches (i.e., different variations of the few-shot learning problem).},
