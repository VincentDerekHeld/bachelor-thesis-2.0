	abstract = {Business process compliance is a key area of business process management and aims at ensuring that processes obey to compliance constraints such as regulatory constraints or business rules imposed on them. Process compliance can be checked during process design time based on veriﬁcation of process models and at runtime based on monitoring the compliance states of running process instances. For existing compliance monitoring approaches it remains unclear whether and how compliance violations can be predicted, although predictions are crucial in order to prepare and take countermeasures in time. This work, hence, analyzes existing literature from compliance monitoring as well as predictive process monitoring and provides an updated framework of compliance monitoring functionalities. Moreover, it raises the vision of a comprehensive predictive compliance monitoring system that integrates existing predicate prediction approaches with the idea of employing {PPM} with diﬀerent prediction goals such as next activity or remaining time for prediction and subsequent mapping of the prediction results onto the given set of compliance constraints ({PCM}). For each compliance monitoring functionality we elicit {PCM} system requirements and assess their coverage by existing approaches. Based on the assessment, open challenges and research directions realizing a comprehensive {PCM} system are elaborated.},

	abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science ({DS}) research in information systems ({IS}). {DS} is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered {DS} research in {IS}, yet over the past 15 years, little {DS} research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for {DS} research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology ({DSRM}) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing {DS} research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating {DS} research in {IS}. The {DS} process includes six steps: problem identiﬁcation and motivation, deﬁnition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the {DSRM}, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an {IS} planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisﬁes the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of {DS} research in the {IS} discipline.},

A central problem in this area is the fact that the acquisition of as-is models consumes up to 60\% of the time spent on process management projects.

In this paper, we tackle this problem based on an automatic approach to generate {BPMN} models from natural language text. We combine existing tools from natural language processing in an innovative way and augmented them with a suitable anaphora resolution mechanism. The evaluation of our technique shows that for a set of 47 text-model pairs from industry and textbooks, we are able to generate on average 77\% of the models correctly.},

In particular, we investigate the usage of the native {GPT}-3 model and few in-context learning customizations that rely on the usage of conceptual definitions and a very limited number of examples for the extraction of typical business process entities and relationships. The experiments we have conducted provide two types of insights. First, the results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, especially for what concerns the extraction of activity, participant, and the performs relation between a participant and an activity it performs. They also highlight the challenge posed by control flow relations. Second, it provides a first set of lessons learned on how to interact with these kinds of models that can facilitate future investigations on this subject.},

Method: Search terms with relevant keywords were used to identify primary studies that relate requirements prioritization classiﬁed under journal articles, conference papers, workshops, symposiums, book chapters and {IEEE} bulletins.
Results: 73 Primary studies were selected from the search processes. Out of these studies; 13 were journal articles, 35 were conference papers and 8 were workshop papers. Furthermore, contributions from symposiums as well as {IEEE} bulletins were 2 each while the total number of book chapters amounted to 13.
Conclusion: Prioritization has been signiﬁcantly discussed in the requirements engineering domain. However, it was generally discovered that, existing prioritization techniques suffer from a number of limitations which includes: lack of scalability, methods of dealing with rank updates during requirements evolution, coordination among stakeholders and requirements dependency issues. Also, the applicability of existing techniques in complex and real setting has not been reported yet.},

However, the documentation existent in organizations about such processes is mostly unstructured and difficult to be understood by analysts. The extracting of process models from textual descriptions may contribute to minimize the effort required in process modeling. In this context, this paper proposes a semi-automatic approach to identify process elements in natural language texts, which may include process descriptions. Therefore, based on the study of natural language processing, we defined a set of mapping rules to identify process elements in texts. In addition, we developed a prototype which is able to semi-automatically identify process elements in texts. Our evaluation shows promising results. The analyses of 56 texts revealed 91.92\% accuracy and a case study showed that 93.33\% of the participants agree with the mapping rules.},

To establish and ensure regulatory compliance, constraints need to be extracted from the documents and integrated into process models capturing existing operational practices. Since regulatory documents and processes are subject to frequent change, the constant comparison between both is mandatory. Additionally, new regulations must be integrated and checked against existing process models. To address these challenges, we provide an approach that uses natural language processing to automatically support compliance assessment between regulatory documents and process model repositories. The outcome is a pairwise matching between parts of a regulatory document and process models from a repository. This matching can be used to either determine the coverage of regulations by a process model or to guide compliance assessment by ranking models based on their ﬁtness and cost. The approach is implemented and applied in two real-world case studies: one from the energy domain and the other based on the General Data Protection Regulation.},

A widely used method for exact graph edit distance computation is based on the A* algorithm. To overcome its high memory load while traversing the search tree for storing pending solutions to be explored, we propose a depth-first graph edit distance algorithm which requires less memory and searching time. An evaluation of all possible solutions is performed without explicitly enumerating them all. Candidates are discarded using an upper and lower bounds strategy. A solid experimental study is proposed; experiments on a publicly available database empirically demonstrated that our approach is better than the A* graph edit distance computation in terms of speed, accuracy and classification rate.},

In this paper, we aim to propose an automatic and interpretable compliance checking approach for design-time business processes. By combining deep learning and a natural language processing approach based on rule templates, we extract semantic information from regulatory documents at different granularities for subsequent compliance checking. In addition, we match appropriate rules to the process model and detect the degree of violation of the business process from three controlflow perspectives. The effectiveness of this method is validated on two real-world datasets.},
