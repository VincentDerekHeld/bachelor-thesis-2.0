\chapter*{Abstract}
\noindent
A comprehensive understanding of business processes is crucial for the digitization of these processes. The utilization of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 process diagrams has emerged as a pivotal tool in both research and industry for representing and analyzing business workflows. These processes are influenced by an ever growing amount of regulatory documents and process execution data.

This thesis is a contribution to develop a state-of-the-art approach for transforming natural language process descriptions to BPMN2.0 process diagrams. The aim is to evaluate how recent developments have evolved compared to existing methods and how well the approach works for process descriptions from more complex regulatory documents (e.g. ISO standards or data protection regulations). Furthermore, it will be investigated which technologies are best suited to visualize the extracted process information in a BPMN2.0 process model.
