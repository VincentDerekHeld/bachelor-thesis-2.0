The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food. She also gives an order to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. Finally, she assigns the order to the waiter. While the kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware). The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guestís room. After returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guestís account. The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver.

Whenever a company makes the decision to go public, its first task is to select the underwriters. Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they play a triple role: First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public.   Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a companyís issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it.  They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public, when they haven’t still found any reason not to do it.

In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.  The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.  The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned.  The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained.  The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach.  The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.  The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;   Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.  Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.  Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.  The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by Union law or Member State law to which the controller is subject.  The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:  Any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;  The context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller;  The nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10;  The possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;  The existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

 	 Processing of personal data is lawful only if the data subject has given consent for one or more specific purposes. Processing is also lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. If requested by the data subject prior to entering into a contract, processing is lawful. The controller processes lawful if they must comply with a legal obligation. If necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person, the processing is lawful. Processing is lawful for tasks carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority given by the controller. It is lawful if it's necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, unless overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject. Public authorities do not apply this if they perform their tasks. Member States, for compliance with specific rules, may introduce specific provisions. Union law or Member State law prescribes the basis for the processing. The purpose of the processing gets determined in that legal basis or for tasks carried out in public interest or in the exercise of official authority by the controller. The Union or the Member State law meets an objective of public interest and corresponds with the legitimate aim. If processing for another purpose is not based on the data subject's consent or on the Union's or Member State law, in order to ascertain compatibility, the controller should consider factors such as: link between collection purposes and the purposes of the further processing, context of collection, relationship between data subjects and the controller, nature of personal data, possible consequences of the further processing for data subjects, and the existence of safeguards.

Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.  If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.  The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.  When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies.   The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.   The data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.   The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2).   The personal data have been unlawfully processed.   The personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.   The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).  Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3).   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

 	 The data subject has the right to request from the controller the erasure of personal data related to him or her.
The controller has the duty to erase the personal data without delay if one of several conditions apply.
These conditions include when the personal data are not needed for the purposes they were collected for.
Another condition is when the data subject withdraws consent, as long as there's no other legal reason for processing.
Also, if the data subject objects to the processing under Article 21(1) without any superior legitimate reasons for processing, or if he or she objects under Article 21(2).
Other conditions include if the personal data have been unlawfully processed or if they need to be erased due to a legal obligation that applies to the controller.
The last condition is if the personal data were collected in association with the offer of information society services according to Article 8(1).
If the controller has publicized the personal data and is obliged to erase them, then he or she must take reasonable steps, considering the available technology and cost of application, to inform other controllers which are processing the data about the data subject's request for erasure of any links to those personal data, or copies or replications of them.
The cases when the controller's obligation to erase data doesn't apply include when processing is needed for practicing the right of freedom of expression and information, when it's necessary for compliance with a legal requirement which needs processing under Union or Member State law, when processing is done in the public's interest or as an exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
The obligation to erase data also doesn't apply if processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the sphere of public health or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
It also doesn't apply if processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

The aim is to remotely interrupt the supply of electrical energy for an object, as a result of a customer change or due to open collection claims, via the central system. The shutdown takes place by opening the breaker present in the terminal. From the central system, a shutdown command is transmitted to the affected terminal. The terminal executes the received command, i.e., the internal breaker interrupts the power supply of the customer system, returns the status of the shutdown to the central system and creates an entry in the logbook. This status must be visible on the terminal. With collection there is no possibility of an immediate on-site reconnection by the customer after the blocking. Input is either deregistration of current customer, customer moves out without new tenant or customer does not pay after admonition process. The supply of electrical energy is interrupted, the status "interrupted" is displayed at the terminal and in the central system. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.

The prepayment function is realized via the central system. The terminal only acts as a switching device. The central system generates the shutdown command by comparing credits with consumption. The comparison of credits with actual consumption value should be made periodically. The basis is the daily readings. A "real-time monitoring" is therefore not necessary. Shutdown may only be carried out in compliance with legal conditions. Each status change of the terminal must be displayed on the device and also create an entry in the logbook. There may be a corresponding customer information about the current balance from the central system to the customer.  Credit or credit limit is consumed and shutdown time is within the legally allowed time window.  The supply of electrical energy is interrupted and the status of the breaker is displayed on the terminal, an entry in the logbook of the terminal is generated and the status is transmitted to the central system.

Exceeding an active power limit set in the meter and activated shuts down the customer system. For the customer, immediate reclosing on site, ie directly at the meter, must be possible. The shutdown, the message of the reclosing and the exceeding of the power threshold must be able to be transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT and also visualized on the meter. Breaker status is, e.g., OFF and READY. An entry is also created in the logbook. In the logbook, in addition to changing the breaker status, the reason for the shutdown, e.g. "Power limit exceeded by xxx watts" can be logged.  Exceeding the power threshold, for example in the context of the basic supply.  Exceeding the power threshold was entered in the logbook of the meter and transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT.

There is an elimination of the terminal on-site by means of a mobile device via the service interface (WZ). In order to meet the strict data protection regulations, the cryptographic parameters that authorize the device to be switched off must be stored on the mobile device. It must therefore not be possible with these cryptographic parameters to turn off several or all terminals of the terminal equipment. The cryptographic parameters must comply with the security concept from "OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering".  Input is either deregistration of current customer or customer moves out without new tenant.  The breaker of the terminal has switched off the system, indicating this on the device. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.

In the course of the so-called opt-out regulation, it must be possible for customers who refuse to install an intelligent electricity meter to deactivate the load profile recording in the meter. Activation / deactivation of load profile recording must be possible remotely (WAN interface). Each of these changes must be logged in the relevant legal logbook of the meter. If the customer is opt-out, it must be displayed on the meter accordingly (for example, display, LED).  Opt-out request of the customer to implement at the NL.  Load profile recording is activated / deactivated and the information has been transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT. A logbook entry has been made in the meter and the current status OPT-OUT is displayed on the meter.

The load switching device is a completely independent of the meter device and serves as a possible replacement for a ripple control device or a timer. The load switching device has its own communication interface and can thus make contact with the control panel. In principle, the relays follow a switching program specified by the central system and stored in the load switching device. However, it must be possible from the central system to override the circuit program with a spontaneous command (eg relay XY "OFF" or "ON"). The next opposite command (either from the switching table or from an external source) changes the state of the switching device. The position of each relay or each switching cycle specified by the switching program must be reported back to the central system. The relay settings must also be visually displayed on site.  The central system sends a command to override a relay ("off" or "on"). The service interface is used to override a relay ("Off" or "On").  The corresponding relay in the load switching device switches to the desired status, reports this back to the central system and the position of the relay on the load switching device is also visible and a logbook entry is made.

For each relay in the load switching device, an independent, independent of the other relay switching program should be configurable. It should be possible to subdivide the circuit program into daily, weekly, seasonal and annual programs taking into account weekly, holiday and special days. The switching program is managed centrally and transmitted to the load switching device via the communication paths. For control purposes, the circuit program must also be read-back. Any change to the circuit program, regardless of whether it is remotely executed, must be logged in a logbook.  The central system sends changed switching programs to the load switching device.   The load switching device receives the changed switching programs (feedback to the central system) and records this in the logbook.
