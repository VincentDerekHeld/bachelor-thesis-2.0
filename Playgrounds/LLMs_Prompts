Follow carefully the instructions and solve the tasks sentence for sentence. Return a simple textual descitption, without adding any extra information, interpretation, numberations or listings.
    -> Example: do not add: „Following the provided instructions, here are the extracted process-relevant steps:“

    1. Decide if the information is relevant for the process. The only information we are interested in are real process steps.
        Examples:
         - Introductions are not relevant.
         - Information on the start of the process / new process instances are not relevant.
         - Information on the end of the process / finished process instances are not relevant.
    	-> If the information is relevant for the process, use this information for the output.
    	-> If not, do not use this information for the output / filter it.

    2. Try to return a text of short precise sentences in active voice, which contain the process relevant information:
    -> Modal verbs, that express the strength of an expression MUST be kept.
        Example modal verbs are: must, shall, should.
    -> ACTION, the ACTOR, the OBJECT and "if", if there is a CONDITION.
     -> "When" can be replaced with "If"
     -> "Otherwise" can be replaced with "Else"
    -> If there is a condition try to structure the sentence like this „If [CONDITION], [ACTOR and ACTION], ELSE [other ACTION, if possible]“.
    -> If two ACTIONs are based on the same CONDITION merge the sentences to a format like: „If [CONDITION], [ACTOR and ACTION], ELSE [other ACTION, if possible]“.
    	Example 1:
    	    „If the controller becomes aware of a personal data breach, the controller shall notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours.“
    	    „If the notification isn't made within 72 hours, the controller shall provide reasons for the delay.“
    	    -> „If the controller becomes aware of a personal data breach, the controller shall notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours, else the controller shall provide reasons for the delay.“ 
        Example 2:
            „The room-service manager at The Evanstonian takes down the order when a guest calls room service.“
            -> If a guest calls room service, the room-service manager at takes down the order.
                Reasons:
                - „The Evanstonian“ is the company and is not relevant for the activity. It represents meta information.
    -> If process steps can be done in parallel start the sentence with „Meanwhile, ….“.
        Example:
        "The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software."
        -> "The Computer Repair Service (CRS) checks and repairs the hardware. In the meanwhile, the Computer Repair Service (CRS) checks and configures the software."

    3. Some sentences use implicit ACTIONS, also try to extract this information and make it explicit in the sentence format explained in Step 2.
        Example 1:
            „Documented information shall be available as evidence of the implementation of the audit programme(s) and the audit results.“
            -> implies the ACTION „document the results“.
        Example 2:
            "The Room Service Manager then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food."
            -> „The Room Service Manager submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares the food.“
            Make sure to keep the order of the sentences and to explicitly name the ACTOR and the ACTION.

    4. Resolve references:
        "she, he, it" refer to an actor. Try to replace the reference with the name of the actor.
        "this, that" refer to an object. Try to replace the reference with the name of the object.
        "these, those" refer to multiple objects. Try to replace the reference with the name of the objects.

    5. Filter reasons for ACTIONs from the result.
    -> Example: „The organization must document information as evidence of the audit programme's implementation and the results.“ --> The correct output is: „The organization must document information of the audit programme's implementation and the results.“ , because „as evidence“ is an example.

    6. Filter information that just adress that the process starts or is finished.
    -> Example: "The process instance is then finished."

    7. For the identification of the ACTOR, keep in mind, a actor can  for e.g. be a natural person, a organization, such as a company or a department, but sometimes also a place, a device or a system can be an valide Actor.
        -> Example: The "Kitchen" represents the "kitchen staff", and so the "Kitchen" is an actor.

    8. The output has to contain full sentences and can not contain list items, such as bullet points.

    ############ Example 1: ############

    ### Input ###
    A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance.

    ### Output ###

    The sales department receives an order.
    A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike.
    In the sales department rejects, the process instance is finished, else the sales department inorms the storehouse and the engineering department.
    The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part.
    If the part is available in-house, it is reserved, else it is back-ordered.
    This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list.
    In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle.
    If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.
    Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer.

     ############ Example 2: ############

    ### Input ###
    Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they play a triple role: First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public.
    Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a company’s issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it.
    They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public, when they haven’t still found any reason not to do it.

    ### Output ###
    The underwriter checks the presented facts.
    If the facts are presented fairly, the underwriter prepares a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), else the underwriter rejects to handle the issue.
    Meanwhile, the underwriter checks that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state.
    The underwriter talks to potential investors.
    If the registration statement is approved, the underwriter fixes the issue price, else the underwriter rejects to handle the issue.
    The unterwriter buys stocks.
    Afterwards, the unterwriter offers the stocks to the public.
