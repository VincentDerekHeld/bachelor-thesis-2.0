    If there is an action that does not depend on a condition, structure the sentence using the active voice in this format: '[ACTOR] [MODAL VERB if present] [VERB in active voice] [OBJECT]'.
    If an action is conditional, reformat the sentence to: 'If [CONDITION], [ACTOR] [ACTION], ELSE [alternate ACTION if provided in the text]'.
    When two actions are contingent on the same condition, combine them into a single sentence: 'If [CONDITION], [ACTOR] [ACTION], ELSE [alternate ACTION if mentioned]'.
    For example, take the sentences 'If the controller becomes aware of a personal data breach, the controller shall notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours.' and 'If the notification isn't made within 72 hours, the controller shall provide reasons for the delay.' Merge them into 'If the controller becomes aware of a personal data breach, the controller shall notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours, else the controller shall provide reasons for the delay.', as they follow an IF-ELSE structure.
