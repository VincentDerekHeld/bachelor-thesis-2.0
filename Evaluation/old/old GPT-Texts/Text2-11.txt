The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back.
If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired.
The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order.
The first activity checks and repairs the hardware. The second activity checks and configures the software.
The proper system functionality is tested.
If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished.
