Whenever the sales department receives an order, the sales department creates a new process instance.
A member of the sales department in the sales department can then decide whether to reject or accept the order for a customized bike.
In the former case, the sales department finishes the process instance.
In the latter case, the sales department informs the storehouse and the engineering department.
The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and the storehouse checks the required quantity of each part.
If the part is available in-house, the sales department reserves the part.
If the product is not available, the sales department back-orders the product.
This procedure is repeated by the sales department for each item on the part list.
If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.
Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer, and the sales department finishes the process instance.
