A customer brings in a defective computer.
The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation.
If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, they continue the process.
Otherwise, they take their computer home unrepaired.
The repair department carries out two activities for the ongoing repair, executing them in an arbitrary order.
The first activity checks and repairs the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software.
After each of these activities, they test the proper system functionality.
If they detect an error, they execute another arbitrary repair activity. Otherwise, they finish the repair.
