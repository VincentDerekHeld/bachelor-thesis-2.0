The customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded.
 The list with all the problem parameters is sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO.
 At the customer service an employee enters a problem report into system T based on the received data.
 The problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify the extent and details of the service degradation.
 Based on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities.
 An electronic service determines the significance of the customer based on information collected during the history of the contractual relationship.
 If the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process.
 If the customer is of certain significance, the process goes back to re-prioritize the counter measures, otherwise the process continues.
 A detailed problem report is created by taking together the information from the contract commitment data and prioritized actions.
 The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management.
 Service Management deals with violations of quality in services provided to customers.
 After receiving the detailed problem report, Service Management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at their department or if it may be located at Resource Provisioning.
 If Service Management cannot analyze the problem, the detailed problem report is sent to Resource Provisioning.
 If Service Management can analyze the problem, they perform the analysis and create a trouble report indicating the type of problem.
 The detailed problem report is checked for any possible problems.
 If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created.
 If a problem is detected, it is analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created.
 The trouble report or normal execution notification is included in a status report and sent back to Service Management.
 The Room Service Manager then prepares the final status report based on the received information.
 It is then determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report.
 Three alternative process paths may be taken.
 If no problem was detected, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service.
 If minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake them and create a problem resolution report to send to Customer Service.
 If automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration and send it to Resource Provisioning.
 Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request, but it must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process.
 After the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked and necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning.
 A trouble-shooting report is created and sent to Service Management, then the process ends.
 The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and goes into the creation of the problem resolution report.
 Customer Service receives either the actual service performance or the problem resolution report.
 Two concurrent activities are triggered: a report is created for the customer detailing the current service performance and resolution of the problem, and an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing.
 The report for the customer is sent out and after all three activities are completed, the process ends within Customer Service.
 After the customer receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.
