 a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.
 The report is then reviewed for automatic approval.
 Amounts under e 1,000 are automatically approved while amounts equal to or over e 1,000 require manual approval.
 The employee must receive a rejection notice by email.

 The employee can send a request for amount rectification.
