Create a process that helps in gathering information about work accidents.
 For insured gainful employment, a work accident is considered to be an accident that occurs in the following circumstances, by way of example: * the accident occurs in a location, at a time and with a cause that correlates to the insured employment * when working from home * on the direct route from the permanent place of residence to work, to lunch or on the way home, whereby carpools are also protected * for training sessions that serve to provide specific professional knowledge, whereby an accident on to way to or from the training centre is considered a work accident * on the way to or from the workplace or training centre with the purpose of taking a child to or collecting them from a childcare facility, a daycare facility, external care or a school, insofar as they have a supervisory responsibility for the child * when making use of advocacy groups or professional associations (e.g. Chamber of Labour, trade union federation, guild etc.)
  
 In an agricultural or forestry establishment, accidents can be considered work accidents if they do not occur directly while performing the insured employment.
 Depending on the protected group of people, the following tasks are covered by accident insurance: * working in the household of the owner of the company and/or the employee, if the household serves the company to a considerable extent * working in connection with providing accommodation for guests * secondary occupations for the sale of agricultural products from the farm * working in the context of erecting, converting and repairing buildings that serve the agricultural and forestry establishment * working in the context of neighbourhood assistance for another agricultural and forestry establishment Certain accidents are considered the same as work accidents and in many cases can also affect people who do not have accident insurance.
 The employees must inform the employer immediately of: * any work accident * any incident that would almost have led to an accident * any serious and immediate risk to safety and health that they discover * any defect discovered in protection systems. The employer must, in turn, immediately report any work accident that leads to a fatality or serious injury to the Labour Inspectorate, if it has not been reported to the emergency services.
 As a self-employed person, please ensure that you not only report accidents involving people you employ but also those that involve you to the accident insurance provider in good time. Students and schoolchildren should report accidents to the competent directorate.
 Schools, educational facilities and universities are obliged to report every work accident through which a person with accident insurance is physically injured or killed within a maximum of five days to the responsible accident insurance provider in triplicate.
 In the case of private insurance, the insured party must report an accident in writing immediately in line with the conditions and to avoid the provider from being released from the obligation to perform.
 If the accident has already been reported.
