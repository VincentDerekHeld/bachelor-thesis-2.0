The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request.
 The requirement is registered.
 The supervisor must approve or reject the request.
 If the request is rejected, the application is returned to the applicant / employee who can review the rejection reasons.
 If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative, who must complete the respective management procedures.
