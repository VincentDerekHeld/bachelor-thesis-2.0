If given the condition that a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager takes down the order.
She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food.
She also gives an order to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages.
If eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage, the room-service manager assigns the order to the waiter.
Else, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware) while the kitchen and sommelier are doing their tasks.
The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guest's room.
After returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guest's account.
If the waiter has another order to prepare or deliver, he may wait to do the billing.
