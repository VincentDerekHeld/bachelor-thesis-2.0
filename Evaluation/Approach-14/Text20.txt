If the customer wants to use or not use the customer interface (H1) anymore, the action item is to activate or deactivate it from the central system, with the default being deactivated. Otherwise, the control center receives an information status as ALARM or EVENT. Additionally, when the customer interface (H1) on the meter is activated or deactivated, there will be an entry in the logbook and the meter will report its status to the control panel as ALARM or EVENT.
