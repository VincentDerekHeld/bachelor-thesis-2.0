If the customer refuses to install an intelligent electricity meter, it must be possible for them to deactivate the load profile recording in the meter. The deactivation of load profile recording must be possible remotely through the WAN interface. Each of these changes must be logged in the relevant legal logbook of the meter. If the customer has opted out, the meter must display this accordingly, for example through a display or LED. The opt-out request of the customer must be implemented at the NL. The load profile recording is activated or deactivated and the information is transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT. A logbook entry is made in the meter and the current status of OPT-OUT is displayed on the meter.
