If given the condition that the cryptographic parameters must comply with the security concept from "OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering", the article "the" and actor "mobile device" must store the cryptographic parameters that authorize the device to be switched off. Else, it must not be possible to turn off several or all terminals of the terminal equipment with these cryptographic parameters. The action item is to eliminate the terminal on-site by means of a mobile device via the service interface (WZ). 

If given the condition that the input is either deregistration of current customer or customer moves out without new tenant, the actor "breaker of the terminal" has switched off the system and indicated this on the device. Else, an entry in the logbook of the terminal must be created. The action item is to create an entry in the logbook of the terminal.
