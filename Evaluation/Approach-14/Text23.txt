If given, for each relay in the load switching device, an independent switching program should be configurable. Else, an independent switching program should be configurable for each relay, independent of the other relay. It should be possible to subdivide the circuit program into daily, weekly, seasonal, and annual programs, taking into account weekly, holiday, and special days. The switching program is managed centrally and transmitted to the load switching device via the communication paths. If given, the circuit program must also be read-back for control purposes. Else, the circuit program must be read-back for control purposes. Any change to the circuit program, regardless of whether it is remotely executed, must be logged in a logbook. The central system sends changed switching programs to the load switching device. The load switching device receives the changed switching programs and records this in the logbook, providing feedback to the central system.
