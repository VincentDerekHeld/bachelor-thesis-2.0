If the control panel sets the operating limit of the meter, then the power limitation requirement threshold should be changed, for example due to contract adjustments. Otherwise, the new threshold should be set, an EVENT should be sent to the central system, and a logbook entry should be made on the meter. If the service interface (WZ) of the meter is available, then the active power limit value of the meter must be able to be set locally. Optionally, this is possible for both energy directions. A logbook entry is generated. If the transmission link (WAN) is available, then this state is transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT.
