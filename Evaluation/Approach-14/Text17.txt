If the active power limit set in the meter is exceeded and activated, the customer system will be shut down. For the customer, it must be possible to immediately reclose on site, directly at the meter. The shutdown, message of reclosing, and exceeding of the power threshold must be able to be transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT, and also visualized on the meter. The breaker status, such as OFF and READY, will be recorded in the logbook. In addition to changing the breaker status, the reason for the shutdown, such as "Power limit exceeded by xxx watts," can be logged in the logbook. If the power threshold is exceeded, for example in the context of the basic supply, it will be entered in the logbook of the meter and transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT.
