If the credits are compared with the actual consumption value periodically, the central system generates the shutdown command. Otherwise, if the comparison is not made periodically, the basis is the daily readings. The terminal only acts as a switching device. Each status change of the terminal must be displayed on the device and also create an entry in the logbook. If the credit or credit limit is consumed and the shutdown time is within the legally allowed time window, the supply of electrical energy is interrupted. Otherwise, if the shutdown time is not within the legally allowed time window, the supply of electrical energy is not interrupted. The status of the breaker is displayed on the terminal, an entry in the logbook of the terminal is generated, and the status is transmitted to the central system. If there is a corresponding customer information about the current balance from the central system to the customer, the prepayment function is realized via the central system. Otherwise, if there is no corresponding customer information, the prepayment function is not realized.
