The methods selected should produce comparable and reproducible results to be considered valid; c) when the monitoring and measuring shall be performed; d) who shall monitor and measure; e) when the results from monitoring and measurement shall be analysed and evaluated; and f) who shall analyse and evaluate these results.
The sentence "Documented information shall be available as evidence of the results" does not contain any listings, so I will go to step 3 and return the sentence without any changes or additional information.
The organization shall evaluate the information security performance and the effectiveness of the information security management system.
